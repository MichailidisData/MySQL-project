## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the covid cases and deaths worldwide from 2020 to 2024 (01-12-2024). By analyzing various aspects of the covid 19 data, we seek to gain a deeper understanding of the rapid spreading of the virus.


## Data Source

https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data?n=c&m49=956
'Weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths by date reported to WHO'


## Tools

- Excel 
- MySQL


## Data Cleaning / Preparation

1. Create a copy table of the existing table. This is the one we will work in and clean the data.  
2. Check for duplicates
3. Replace all NULL or BLANKS with 0
4. Remove columns that we do not need


## Data Analysis

- death percentage per case for each year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2024)
- increase in deaths (%) per year (20 - 21), (21 - 22), (22 - 23), (23 - 24)


## Extra Information

Users should note that, in addition to capturing new cases and deaths reported on any given day, updates are made retrospectively to correct counts on previous days as needed based on subsequent information received.
